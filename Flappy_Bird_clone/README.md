## UI and Demonstration : 

We need to click the left mouse button to make the bird jump and the main focus of the game is to jump through the space between the pillars. The more pillars we get passed through the more score we get which is visible in the bottom side of the page. We have to avoid hitting the pillars, doing that will lead to the game to end and after that a alert message pops up saying our score , and then we can click the left mouse button again to start the game again.
